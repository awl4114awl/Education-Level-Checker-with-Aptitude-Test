### Education Level Checker with Career Aptitude Test

This script allows users to check their education level and provides a career aptitude test. Based on the user's education level and primary interest, the script suggests a suitable career along with detailed information such as average salary, job outlook, required education, and a career description. The script also stores user data and provides a summary of entries by education level.

## How the Script Works

#### 1. Importing Required Libraries

The script starts by importing the required libraries. Since we are using a mock dataset, no external libraries are needed.

#### Step 2: Add the Mock Dataset

Inside the `education_level_checker.py` file, add the following mock dataset. This dataset includes average salary, job outlook, required education, and a brief description for each career:
